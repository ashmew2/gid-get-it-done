Building GID Server
-------------------

    $ g++ gidserver.cpp -std=c++11 -Wall -lpthread -o gidserver

RUNNING GID SERVER
------------------

    $ ./gidserver

After this, execute (from another terminal):
    $ tda --timer 10 alarm

will set a timer for 10 seconds and sound the alarm.

ABOUT GID SERVER
----------------

The gid server is at the center of gid and takes care of :
    -   Handle calls to tda --timer
    -   Listen to TCP based requests for delayed execution
    (Basically, executes a command after waiting for a designated time period)

Format for sending commands to gid server:
    -   Regex: [0-9]+ [^;]+;
    -   String explanation: <numbers><space><commands without the ; character><;>

NOTES for ALARMS
----------------
If you want to sound alarms, gid uses mpg123 (for now anyway), install it.

on Debian based distros,
   # apt-get install mpg123

on a Gentoo machine,
   # emerge mpg123

on Redhat based distros,
   # yum install mpg123

on Darwin machines (OSX),
   # possibly use homebrew, or suggest a better method than mpg123

---------------------------
