Road to the first release
=========================

(Because otherwise, the scope is positive infinity)

Fully functional TCP listener (gidserver.cpp)
Fully functional unix socket(file) listener (gidserver.cpp)
A fully functional unix socket(file) client (gid.sh)
A fully functional TCP client (gidclient.cpp)
A gid conf file being used by the server with SIGHUP to reload its contents.
Bugfixes
TODO fixes (in scope wrt above)
------------------------------------------------

RANDOM NOTES:
=============
Linux GUI client which just gets shit done with gid.

UDP based server/clients for one-shot non-persistent requests

Authentication of clients with the server

adb-pull and adb-push should be a part of the next major release as it does not
fit in well with the scope above (for now)
As those scripts already exist, those can be git rm --cached -> stashed and then
the release tag made. After the release tag is made properly (With release notes),
can continue with adb and doing other android/ios related stuff.

TESTING for the release
=======================

Goes without saying, needs to be stable, so need some tests from the tcpclient and
file client which send bogus data and try to make gidserver cry it's eyes out.
They, of course, test for the correct cases as well.
